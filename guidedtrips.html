The summers of his youth were spent in Aspen where he fell in love with fishing in the cold rivers and high mountain lakes of Colorado.<br /> <br /> <strong>After enlisting in the USMC infantry and serving in Iraq, he graduated from Colorado State University.</strong><br /> <br />

Soon after he followed his passion to his favorite place in the world,the Roaring Fork Valley. His favorite thing in the world is to help people to catch fish and to share the magic, tranquility, and beauty that is the Roaring Fork Valley.</p>

Fishing most of his life, Marty owes his passion to his grand father who used to take him and his brother fishing every weekend to a lake, stream or reservoir. <br>

Marty has a Mathematics degree from The Ohio State University, (Go Buckeyes), and after college decided to move <br>to the Rocky Mountains.<br /> <br />

<strong>His <i class="fa fa-instagram" aria-hidden="true"></i> Instagram handle is @Martyj2405.</strong><br /><br />

He loves the outdoors and chasing beautiful trout in an exceptionally gorgeous landscape. He enjoys dry fly fishing as well as tugging big streamers on our gold medal Rivers here in the Roaring Fork Valley.<br> 

So if you are looking for a positive laid back educational fishing experience, he would love to show you around our local Rivers. </p>
