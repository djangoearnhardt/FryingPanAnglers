Frying Pan Anglers Website Redesign / of this site http://fryingpananglers.com/

I used Bootstrap and my own HTML / CSS into a redesign of a dated Fly Fishing Website. 

This was done for practice / fun. Some of the pictures are missing since their actual shopping site has gone offline. 

The logo used to be a .png and it pains me to have a .jpg with white in the header, but I used URL's for source images to keep the design lighter.
