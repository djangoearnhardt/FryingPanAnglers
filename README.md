Frying Pan Anglers Website Redesign / of this site http://fryingpananglers.com/

I designed and created a redesign of a dated Fly Fishing Website using Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS. 

This was done for practice and fun. Some of the pictures are missing since their actual shopping site has gone offline. 

The logo used to be a .png and it pains me to have a .jpg with white in the header, but I used URL's for source images to keep the design lighter.
